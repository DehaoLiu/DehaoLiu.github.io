* I am a Ph.D. student in the [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), advised by Prof. [Yan Wang](https://www.me.gatech.edu/faculty/wang-y) in the [Multi-Scale Systems Engineering Research Group](https://msse.gatech.edu/).
* My research interest is to investigate the Process-Structure-Property relationship during Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process using physics-based modelling and machine learning algorithms. My ultimate goal is to construct the process-structure-property relationship in additive manufacturing for optimization of process and design. 
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html). My undergraduate research advisors are Prof. [Yiming Rong](https://mee.sustech.edu.cn/2016/node1_0809/130.html) and Prof. [Gang Wang](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/jxxen/4192/2014/20141108142525343207364/20141108142525343207364_.html).
