* I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Computational Materials Science Lab](https://arroyavelab.tamu.edu/) and [Scientific Machine Learning Lab](https://sciml.tamids.tamu.edu/)at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Raymundo Arroyave](https://engineering.tamu.edu/materials/profiles/arroyave-raymundo.html) and Prof. [Ulisses Braga-Neto](https://engineering.tamu.edu/electrical/profiles/ubraganeto.html).

* I received my Ph.D. from at the [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), advised by Prof. [Yan Wang](https://www.me.gatech.edu/faculty/wang-y) in the [Multi-Scale Systems Engineering Research Group](https://msse.gatech.edu/). My dissertation title is "*Investigation of process-structure relationship for additive manufacturing with multiphysics simulation and physics-constrained machine learning*".

* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html). My undergraduate research advisors are Prof. [Yiming Rong](https://mee.sustech.edu.cn/2016/node1_0809/130.html) and Prof. [Gang Wang](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/jxxen/4192/2014/20141108142525343207364/20141108142525343207364_.html).

# Research Interests
The overall goal of my research is to establish comprehensive and robust **process-structure-property (P-S-P) relationships** for the systematic process and materials design by combining **multiscale multiphysics simulation** and **physics-constrained machine learning**. The main research thrust areas are listed as follows.

* Multiscale Multiphysics Modeling and Simulation

* Physics-Constrained Machine Learning

* Scalable Versatile Bayesian Optimization
