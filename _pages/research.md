### Mesoscale Multiphysics Simulation of Nucleation and Grain Growth of Ti-6Al-4V Alloy in Selective Laser Melting
* A mesoscale multi-physics model is developed to simulate the solidification process in SLM based on Phase Field and Thermal Lattice Boltzmann Methods
* The PF-TLBM model incorporates solute transport, heat transfer, fluid dynamics, kinetics of phase transformation, nucleation and grain growth
* It simulates systems at a reasonable time scale for manufacturing processes while providing fine-grained material phase and composition information

### Physics-constrained Machine Learning
* A novel Multi-fidelity Physics-constrained Neural Network (MFPCNN) is proposed to reduce the required amount of training data, where physical knowledge is applied to constrain neural networks

* The PCNN is effective for these two different types of PDEs with different boundary conditions, which demonstrate its generalization

* By using the MFPCNN, the desired accuracy can be attained without turning to the expensive HFPCNN for the whole time period
