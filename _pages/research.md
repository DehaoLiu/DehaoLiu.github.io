### Mesoscale Multiphysics Simulation of Nucleation and Grain Growth of Ti-6Al-4V Alloy in Selective Laser Melting
* A mesoscale multi-physics model is developed to simulate the solidification process in SLM based on Phase Field and Thermal Lattice Boltzmann Methods
* The PF-TLBM model incorporates solute transport, heat transfer, fluid dynamics, kinetics of phase transformation, nucleation and grain growth
* It simulates systems at a reasonable time scale for manufacturing processes while providing fine-grained material phase and composition information.
